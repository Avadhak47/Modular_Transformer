GSM8K sample item: {'question': 'Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?', 'answer': 'Natalia sold 48/2 = <<48/2=24>>24 clips in May.\nNatalia sold 48+24 = <<48+24=72>>72 clips altogether in April and May.\n#### 72'}

GSM8K sample item: {'question': "Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?", 'answer': 'Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = <<16-3-4=9>>9 duck eggs a day.\nShe makes 9 * 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 every day at the farmer’s market.\n#### 18'}

MATH sample item: {'problem': 'Let \\[f(x) = \\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{cl} ax+3, &\\text{ if }x>2, \\\\\nx-5 &\\text{ if } -2 \\le x \\le 2, \\\\\n2x-b &\\text{ if } x <-2.\n\\end{array}\n\\right.\\]Find $a+b$ if the piecewise function is continuous (which means that its graph can be drawn without lifting your pencil from the paper).', 'level': 'Level 5', 'type': 'Algebra', 'solution': 'For the piecewise function to be continuous, the cases must "meet" at $2$ and $-2$. For example, $ax+3$ and $x-5$ must be equal when $x=2$. This implies $a(2)+3=2-5$, which we solve to get $2a=-6 \\Rightarrow a=-3$. Similarly, $x-5$ and $2x-b$ must be equal when $x=-2$. Substituting, we get $-2-5=2(-2)-b$, which implies $b=3$. So $a+b=-3+3=\\boxed{0}$.'}
