## üö® **CRITICAL FINDINGS FOR HPC DEPLOYMENT**

### **Pre-Deployment Blockers**
1. **Environment Setup Required**:
   ```bash
   pip install accelerate>=0.26.0 peft jsonlines
   ```

2. **Import Path Issues**:
   - Need to fix PYTHONPATH setup in HPC environment
   - Relative imports cause failures in distributed settings

3. **Memory Considerations**:
   - Model loading successful with small models
   - Full DeepSeekMath-7B will require GPU memory management

### **HPC-Specific Risks**
1. **Job Failure Points**:
   - Import errors will cause immediate job termination
   - Missing dependencies can't be installed mid-job
   - Path issues amplified in distributed settings

2. **Resource Waste**:
   - Failed jobs waste HPC allocation time
   - Queue waiting time significant for reruns

## üõ†Ô∏è **REQUIRED FIXES BEFORE HPC DEPLOYMENT**

### **High Priority** (Must Fix)
1. ‚úÖ Fix PE import registry alignment
2. ‚úÖ Resolve relative import issues  
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Create proper environment setup script
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Add dependency validation in run script

### **Medium Priority** (Should Fix)
1. Add graceful fallbacks for optional dependencies
2. Improve error handling in training setup
3. Add memory usage monitoring

### **Low Priority** (Nice to Have)
1. Enhanced logging for debugging
2. Progress monitoring utilities
3. Automatic checkpoint recovery
